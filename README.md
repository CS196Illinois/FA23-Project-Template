Project Description: We plan on developing a mobile application that could be used by people suffering from dementia in senior centers. Playing music from one's childhood has been shown to bring back a person's memories and even alleviate dementia symptoms. Our app will allow users to input a person's birth year and location to generate a list of popular songs from a person's childhood, allowing those working with dementia patients to more easily volunteer and help those around them.
